### üëã Hello there!

I'm Amit, a Lead Data Scientist at Microsoft Heathcare based in Berlin. With over a decade of experience in AI and machine learning, I specialize in building and deploying robust AI-driven solutions esepcially in Heathcare (Clinical Note Generation), particularly using large language models (LLMs), MLOps, and Responsible AI practices. My work spans various industries, helping organizations leverage cutting-edge AI technologies to drive innovation and solve complex challenges. Since last year I have joined Microsoft Healthcare and Life Science applied research team to help doctors with automating clinical note generation.

## üöÄ What I Do
I'm passionate about advancing AI to serve humanity, and my work focuses on making AI accessible, reliable, and beneficial. Below is an overview of my key areas of expertise:

### üõ† Technologies & Tools
- **Machine Learning & AI:** Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn, Hugging Face Transformers, GPT, LLaMA, Phi, Mistral models
- **Advanced Techniques:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Fine-tuning, Model Distillation, LLM Benchmarking, Responsible AI frameworks, RLHF
- **Cloud & MLOps:** Azure (AI Studio, Datastores, ML, App Service), Google Cloud, AWS (S3, EC2, EKS, SageMaker), Databricks, Apache Spark, Kubernetes, Docker
- **Data & Visualization:** Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks, SQL, Plotly, Streamlit, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Highcharts
- **Web Development:** Flask, Vue.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Jinja2, Bootstrap
- **Search & Analytics:** Azure AI Search, Elasticsearch, Apache Solr, Kibana

## üåü Featured Projects
- **[Microsoft Dragon Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/health-solutions/clinical-workflow/dragon-copilot):** Leading European applied research team for Microsoft Dragon Copilot to scale the solution in various EU markets.
- **Autonomous Driving Safety System:** Developed an AI model using Phi-3v and GPT to detect abnormal driving conditions, such as accidents or road hazards, with real-time, low-latency performance on edge devices.
- **LLM-Based Chatbots and Summarizers:** Created customer-facing chatbots and summarizers using Hugging Face models, tailored for specific business needs, enhancing engagement and operational efficiency.
- **LLM Benchmarking and Fine-Tuning:** Led a benchmarking initiative at Microsoft to evaluate open-source LLMs like GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral against proprietary models, optimizing them for customer-specific applications.

## üõ°Ô∏è Responsible AI
I am committed to ensuring AI solutions are developed and deployed responsibly. In my role as Lead RAI Champ at Microsoft, I helped built and led a virtual team of 60+ RAI Champs, collaborating with global teams to embed ethical AI practices in all projects, focusing on fairness, transparency, and safety.
